                         and he even writes about them regularly online. He’s also passionate about cooking,

                            Victor Wong graduated from City University of Hong Kong with a first-class honours
                            degree in English. His undergraduate studies covered Linguistics, Translation, English
                            Literature and Cultural Studies, and he uses all these elements to provide well-
                            rounded teaching to his students. Before coming to i-Learner, he gained experience
                            teaching in a variety of settings, including secondary schools, an English learning
                            centre, and on an individual basis.
                            Victor’s love of languages has led him to become fluent in Swiss German and Korean
                            as well as English. He has also been able to experience immersive language learning
                            environments while living in Switzerland and New Zealand. His own language-
                            learning journeys have given him an appreciation for immersion and authentic
                            interactions. He strives hard to bring both of these elements into the classroom when
                            he teaches.

                            and has learned from students who have a deep interest in Chinese literature and culture. This
                            learning experience has enabled her to have more knowledge and inspiration for Chinese
                            literature. In addition to literature, Ms. Tsoi is also deeply interested in physical geography, so
                            she studied Geography. She went to Australia to participate in a geographical expedition to
                            understand the impact of crustal activity on land and sea. During her studies, Ms. Tsoi worked in
                            tutorial schools and further enrolled in education-related courses. She therefore understands the
                            current learning difficulties of students and the exam modes of mainstream schools. She hopes
                            that students can apply what they have learned and love learning.

                                The Chinese language plays a greater role in Hong Kong society than ever before. At the same time, the discrepancy between the written and oral forms of the language can make it seem distant from our everyday lives. As a teacher, I love to share the true beauty of this language with children and show them that Chinese is not just a school subject, but a language to live with.
