                         Using grammar contextually is a prerequisite for achieving satisfactory results in exams, 
                         yet it is often a great challenge facing many local school students. 
                         With a wide variety of fun activities, this course will provide students with a 
                         foundation of solid grammar and rigorous reading skills that can then be applied effectively during 
                         reading and writing.
